The **TodoApp** List application is a simple task management tool built using **React**. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks with ease. Each task has a name, a status indicating whether it is completed or not, and can be assigned a priority level (low, medium, or high). The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface for managing tasks, displaying them in an organized manner. Additionally, the application includes features such as a counter for total tasks and completed tasks, and it utilizes local storage to persist tasks even after page refreshes. With its responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**, the Todo List app offers a seamless experience across various devices.
